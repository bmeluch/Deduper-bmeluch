CIGAR: CIGAR string. The CIGAR operations are given in the following table (set ‘*’ if unavailable):

Op  BAM Description                                             Consumes query  Consumes reference
M   0   alignment match (can be a sequence match or mismatch)   yes             yes
I   1   insertion to the reference                              yes             no
D   2   deletion from the reference                             no              yes
N   3   skipped region from the reference                       no              yes
S   4   soft clipping (clipped sequences present in SEQ)        yes             no
H   5   hard clipping (clipped sequences NOT present in SEQ)    no              no
P   6   padding (silent deletion from padded reference)         no              no
=   7   sequence match                                          yes             yes
X   8   sequence mismatch                                       yes             yes

• “Consumes query” and “consumes reference” indicate whether the CIGAR operation causes the
alignment to step along the query sequence and the reference sequence respectively.
• H can only be present as the first and/or last operation.
• S may only have H operations between them and the ends of the CIGAR string.
• For mRNA-to-genome alignment, an N operation represents an intron. For other types of alignments, the interpretation of N is not defined.
• Sum of lengths of the M/I/S/=/X operations shall equal the length of SEQ.

I don't know how people are writing it to use so little memory without a sorted file.
